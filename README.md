# continuous-prints-klipper
In an attempt to set up continuous printing on a Klipper enabled 3D printer, little information could be found regarding this. With Octoprint, there are various plugins for accomplishing this task (for example: [Continuous Print plugin](https://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/continuousprint/)). In Klipper, a job queue can be set up to continuously receive prints from the user's preferred slicer of choice.
